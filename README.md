# waste-segregation-using-deep-learning
The problem statement:
Inadequate waste segregation practices lead to challenges in reducing general waste output, identifying reusable items, and recycling materials, ultimately causing a detrimental impact on the environment. Improperly sorted trade waste ends up in landfills, mimicking the same mixed state as it was in the bins. Consequently, the decomposition of waste items like food scraps, paper, and liquid waste releases harmful runoff into the soil and emits noxious gases into the atmosphere.
